This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React hooks
This project uses react hooks instead of the lifecycle methods.

## Redux React hooks binding
redux-react-hook takes care of providing methods for binding the state of the store into the react function components and also provides a dispatcher.

## Redux sagas
redux-saga is an alternative to thunk middleware that provides a more comprehensive approach to handle the side-effects of the app. In this project example, data is is received through simulated calls and examined to determine the next state of the app.
